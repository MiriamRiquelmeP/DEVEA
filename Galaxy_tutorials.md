In order to facilitate the generation of their own data, users can access the following 2 complete pipelines for Galaxy platform. 
With them, a step-by-step protocol to generate read counts from RNA-seq .fastq data without any bioinformatics knowledge can be performed.
Quality control and some downstream analysis similar to that performed in DEVEA can be explored following this pipeline as well.

- Analyse and convert RNA-seq reads to counts to introduce in DEVEA: Maria Doyle, Belinda Phipson, Harriet Dashnow, 1: RNA-Seq reads to counts (Galaxy Training Materials). https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-reads-to-counts/tutorial.html Online; accessed Mon Nov 14 2022
