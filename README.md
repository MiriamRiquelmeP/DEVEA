# DEVEA
an interactive shiny application for Differential Expression analysis, data Visualization and Enrichment Analysis of transcriptomics data.

We are at a time of considerable growth in the use and development of transcriptomics studies and subsequent in silico analysis. RNA sequencing is one of the most widely used approaches, now integrated in many studies. 
The processing of these data may typically require a noteworthy number of steps, statistical knowledge, and coding skills which is not accessible to all scientists. Despite the undeniable development of software applications over the years to address this concern, it is still possible to improve. 
Here we present DEVEA, an R shiny application tool developed to perform differential expression analysis, data visualization and enrichment pathway analysis mainly from transcriptomics data, but also from simpler gene lists with or without statistical values. 
Its intuitive and easy-to-manipulate interface facilitates gene expression exploration through numerous interactive figures and tables, statistical comparisons of expression profile levels between groups and further meta-analysis such as enrichment analysis, without bioinformatics expertise.
DEVEA performs a thorough analysis from multiple and flexible input data representing distinct analysis stages. From them, it produces dynamic graphs and tables, to explore the expression levels and statistical differential expression analysis results. Moreover, it generates a comprehensive pathway analysis to extend biological insights. Finally, a complete and customizable HTML report can be extracted for further result exploration outside the application. DEVEA is accessible at https://shiny.imib.es/devea/ and the source code is available on our GitHub repository https://github.com/MiriamRiquelmeP/DEVEA.
